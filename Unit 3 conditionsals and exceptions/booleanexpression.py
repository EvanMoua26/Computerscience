#Boolean Expression
#Kinda like a mathematical formula 
# can only evaluate to true or false 
# Are my shoes tie? > True 
# is 5 > 7 False 
print (5 > 7)

# Comparison operators! == > < >= <=
# Kinda like arithmetic operators! + - /* ** % // 
x = 5               # set x equal to 5  tell it what to be 
print(x == 5 )      # get x equals 5, ask a question 
# The differnce is that we are using one or two equal signs 
# This is a perfect test question 

print( 4 >= 2 )    # True 
print(1993 == 1993) #True 
print(-90 < -99 ) # False 
print(10 != 10 )  #false, "bash" "not"
