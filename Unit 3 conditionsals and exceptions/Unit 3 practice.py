# **Equal to (==)**: Checks if two operands are equal. For example, `5 == 3` results in `false`.
  # **Greater than (>)**: Checks if the first operand is greater than the second. For example, `5 > 3` results in `true`.
 # **Less than (<)**: Checks if the first operand is less than the second. For example, `5 < 3` results in `false`.
#**Greater than or equal to (>=)**: Checks if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second. For example, `5 >= 3` results in `true`.
 # **Less than or equal to (<=)**: Checks if the first operand is less than or equal to the second. For example, `5 <= 3` results in `false`.
