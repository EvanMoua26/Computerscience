#for loops 
#this is a big deal 
#for loops allow the programmer to reapet , or waht we all loop

#write a progarm that prints the numbers one through ten

for i in range (0,10): # o is the start value, 20 is the stop value 
    print(i)

#repeats everything in the for loop for each items in the list 
#where food equals the current item 


#practice : Create a list of groceries-
#contains milk, eggs, bread, Butter, apples 
# ASk for user input on  an item they added to the cart
# if the item was on the list , print ("Item> crossed off the list!") 
#remove that item from the list 
#you will need to use a for loop to search for that item 
#you will need an if satemtn if the for loop to check
